### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on getting used to working on projects on GitHub

and working in Jupyter and Pythong again after a long break. I've learned 

Java, C++, and MATLAB before and I am pretty comfortable with those languages.

You can contact me through my email : *mnmodi@iastate.edu*
